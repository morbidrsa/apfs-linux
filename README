Linux APFS
----------

This repository provides an initial and incomplete implementation of
APFS for Linux.

It pre-dates Apple's official documentation of the APFS on-disk
structures so the naming is not correct yet.

What works:
- Mounting disks
- Listing small directories
- Reading single block files

What doesn't:
- Listing bigger directories
- Multi block (e.g. bigger 4K Bytes) files
- Compression
- Encryption
- Freeing up memory when it's unneeded

This file system is neither ready for production nor ready for
submission to the mainline Linux kernel, although both is planned.
